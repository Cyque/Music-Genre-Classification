Support Vector Classification used.

Simple 8 fold validation is done in this case. With the validation phase only checking hit rate.


Training Set:

30 songs total.
10 from each genre: House, Dubstep, Trance
200 sample pack from each song: 2000:2200. 
	sample pack size: 512


We are only training on each sample pack. I.e each sample pack is classified to a genre.

Features used:
Centroid - al
Rolloff


Notes:
With three possible genres, if a class was randomly chosen, we would expect a hit rate of 30%.

Results:

remember these are hit rates for each sample pack classification.
Centroid only: 
	hitrate: 34% - 36% 
Centroid and Rolloff:
	hitrate: 35% - 41%


Thoughts and plans:

Because we are only classifying each sample pack individually, we are losing some important temporal information. Also, no averages are taken.
